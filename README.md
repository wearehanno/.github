# GitHub Standards

This repository allows us to share our most commonly used workflows and shared repository preferences across the whole of the @wearehanno organisation on GitHub.

You can find out more about how it works inside the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/sharing-workflows-with-your-organization#using-a-workflow-template-from-your-organization).
